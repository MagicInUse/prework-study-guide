# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was a pleasant appetizer and hint of what is to come. If used correctly, this project could continue to flourish during the development of the student's brain! My motivation in creating this repo is to get a good head-start on what to expect with the boot camp course. I was familiar with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, but learning Git has been an eye-opener to version control and how to work with others on a single project. It is a very useful tool for developers!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, there is a fancy randomizer function that will help you identify a starting point! Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) and a console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
